        <h3>Trip to Prague, Czech Republic</h3>
        <p>This report is about our recent trip to Prague in the small country East of Germany, known as Czech Republic. Maruf, Rafi bhai and I went there by Flixbus. It is a very small but happening city. We stayed there for one night and one day, and within that timeframe, covered most of the scenic places there. The place was picturesque, the weather was cozy, and the food was awesome. We enjoyed a lot within the short time we stayed there in Prague.</p>
